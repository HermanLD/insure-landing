- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/insure-landing-page-uTU68JV8) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

- See a list of jobs in a city by default
- Search for jobs with a given keyword
- Search for jobs with a city name, zip code, or other location
- Select one option from at least 4 pre-defined options
- Search for a full-time job only
- See a list of jobs with their logo, company name, location, and posted time.
- When I select a job, I can see job descriptions and how to apply like the given design.
- When I am on the job details page, I can go back to the search page
- (optional): I can see a list of jobs in the closest city from my location by default
- (optional): I can see jobs on different pages, 5 items on each page

## How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/HermanLD/insure-landing

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Compiles and hot-reloads Eleventy for development
$ npm run start

# Run tailwind CLI watch mode

## Troubleshooting

- Environment variable issue in [Windows](https://github.com/gregwolanski/eleventy-tailwindcss-alpinejs-starter/issues/3).
- Running eleventy serve & tailwindcss watch simultaniously in npm scripts:
  Original setup had tailwind and 11ty run in the same script but when run, would freeze.
  Now you will have to split the terminal and run dev and start separately.
